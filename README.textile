h1. EVE Metrics Uploader 2

This repository contains version 2 of the EVE Metrics Uploader, a Reverence-based cache decoder and upload client designed to take market-relevant EVE cache data, decode it and put it in a standard CSV format, then upload it to a host.

EVE Metrics may be gone but the code lives on. Make use of it.

h2. Debugging and Development

Anyone is welcome to contribute to this uploader. The main reason for open sourcing the code is to enable people to help us maintain it and to enable faster debugging of issues in the upload chain.

We're also aware of the trust implications of EVE-related apps that are closed source. We'd much rather have everything open source.
